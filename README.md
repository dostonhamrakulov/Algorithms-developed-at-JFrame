#1. Circle Line Algorithm:

The main task:

1. During class you will be given the first half of the Circle line algorithm that can draw 1/8 of a circle, complete this algorithm so that it could draw a full circle (using symmetry). The circle should always be drawn in the center of the program window, the radius is defined through a text field.

The additional task:

2. Make it possible to define the position and size of the circle by using the mouse (cursor position), by defining 2 points: the center of the circle and a tangent point (point of tangency).



#2. Straight Line Algorithm

The main task:

1. During class you will be given the first half of the Bresenham algorithm that can draw straight horizontal lines (where dx>dy), complete this algorithm so that it could draw straight vertical lines (where dy>dx). The coordinates of the first and last point of the line are defined using 4 text fields.

The additional task:

2. Make it possible to define the coordinates of the first and last point of the line, by clicking on the image and using the mouse cursor position.



#3. Bezier curve algorithm

The main task:

1. During class you will be given the Bezier algorithm that can draw a Bezier curve with 3 control points. Change this program so that it would draw a Bezier curve with a different amount of control points, per your variant (see Table below).

The additional task:

2. Make it possible to change the amount of control points (from 3 to 12), and draw the Bezier curve with these points.


#4. 2D Transformation

The main task:

1. During class you will be given the transformation algorithm that can rotate an object that is made from three control points. Change this program so that it could perform all transformations (rotate, move, scale) with an object. The amount of control points of the object should be taken from the table below.

The additional task:

2. Make it possible to change the amount of control points (up to 11), and make it possible to rotate the object around any point
